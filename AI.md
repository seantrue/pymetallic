### 5. Wheel Packaging Fix (2025-09-30)

**Problem Identified:**

The v0.2.2 wheel uploaded to PyPI was missing the dylib file, causing runtime failures:
```
OSError: dlopen(libpymetallic.dylib, 0x0006): tried: 'libpymetallic.dylib' (no such file)
```

**Investigation:**
- Local wheel built with `uv build` included dylib (200KB)
- PyPI wheel v0.2.2 missing dylib (only 29KB)
- `pyproject.toml` had `artifacts = ["*.dylib"]` configuration
- Configuration was correct but wheel had been built incorrectly

**Solution:**
- Rebuilt wheel with proper inclusion of `src/pymetallic/libpymetallic.dylib`
- Verified dylib presence: 83,888 bytes at `pymetallic/libpymetallic.dylib`
- Tested in isolated environment with fresh install
- Smoke test passed: ✅ No smoke seen!

**Version Bump:** 0.2.2 → 0.2.3

**Files Modified:**
- `pyproject.toml` (version bump)
- Wheel rebuild with corrected packaging
